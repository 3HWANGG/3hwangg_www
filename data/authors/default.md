I currently work in Bordeaux as a Marketing Project Manager at Octopia. Graduated from a Master Grande Ecole in Excelia Business School, I am passionate about digital and new technologies.

During my various professional experiences, I was able to discover many sectors of activity such as wines and spirits at Pernod Ricard where I had the opportunity to spend a year as a digital marketing project manager for the French and international market.

Then I had the opportunity to discover the B to B activity at Microsoft. In my free time, I work with companies in the digital field through the company I co-founded: Fabrilab.
