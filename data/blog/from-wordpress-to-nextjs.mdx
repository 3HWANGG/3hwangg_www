In the middle of 2021, I did some research to do a redesign of my personal website. This one was starting to get pretty old, I had created it in 2019 during my search for an apprenticeship contract in an effort to stand out from the crowd. It was built on the most used and popular CMS in the world: [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/). It was running on one of the most popular themes : [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/) from **Elegant Theme**. As a Divi fan, I found that it didn't really fit me anymore and I was looking for a **new challenge**.

# How I discovered Next.js ?

During the research I came across many **inspiring portfolios and personal websites**, these websites had one thing in common:
  -  Fluidity and speed of execution
  -  Minimalist design

Here is a list of my favorite portfolios & personal websites :
  - [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/)
  - [Nev Flynn](https://nevflynn.com/)
  - [Rauno](https://rauno.me/)
  - [Marc Bouchenoire](https://marcbouchenoire.com/)
  - [Lee Rob](https://leerob.io/)

They also had another thing in common, they were running on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), a framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org/). During my research I also found that they were very efficient from an SEO point of view. Google with its Page Lighthouse module rates almost all sites based on Next.js with scores between 90 and 100 in the 4 different rating criteria.

###Here is a comparison of my old site vs the new one :

## How did I learn the basics of JavaScript and Next?

As mentioned above, I've been working on WordPress for more than 6 years now, so I've been a low-code user. But despite everything I was able to acquire good technical bases from a css and or html point of view, with notably the use of snippets for Divi for example.

I naturally trained myself with the resources available on the [Next] website (https://nextjs.org/learn/foundations/about-nextjs). There's a pretty good tutorial to build your first application with Next. The tutorial covers the basics, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Afterwards I also discovered that Next was followed by a large community of developers. It also allows to ask for advices and to receive good practices.While exploring the many themes of the community, I came across a very promising template : [Tailwind nextjs starter blog template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) from [`@timlrx`](https://github.com/timlrx).
