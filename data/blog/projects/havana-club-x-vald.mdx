In 2018 as part of its new brand strategy, Havana Club made a collaboration with a French artist: VALD. The opportunity for the artist to create his first bottle with his signature design.

## A unique collaboration

As part of this new collaboration in 2018, I had the opportunity to work closely with the Digital Manager in the implementation of this project.

J'ai notamment participé à plusieurs aspects du projet, notamment dans la gestion et la création des bouteilles en édition limitée.

• Operational implementation of the digital strategy
• Monitoring and implementation of media partnerships: 3M of reach on 2 media operations
• Community Management of the Havana Club Facebook page: 3M reach and 65k interactions generated over the period
• Management of the agencies (Sending out briefs, monitoring and coordination of projects...)
• Handling of the e-influence programme which totalled more than 22M reach
• Monitoring of the Havana Club e-CRM programme: 25% opening rate and 5% click rate
