## Creation of a web design agency

In 2017, I created with a partner a communication agency specialized in digital. We collaborate with small and large companies in their digital transformation. As a creative agency we have developed ideas, products and digital experiences to better connect our clients with their customers.

### Website goals:

- Gain awareness in France
- Increase customer engagement
- Create a responsive website that is effective on both mobile and computer
- Create a "Shop" space to effectively display the products available for sale
- Include "Click & Collect" functionality.

## Achievements

To meet the expectations of the customer, I structured the site to make it **readable, accessible and engaging**. The objective is to **highlight the brand Toy Surfboards and the expertise of Didier DAMESTOY**, to include the entire catalog in order to allow the customer to **navigate quickly on the site** and choose his custom surfboard adapted to **his desires and abilities**. I also accompanied Toy Surfboards in the development of an **Instagram Shop**.

**All the pages of the site meet the standards and recommendations of websites:**

- both in terms of SEO;
- adaptable on different supports (mobile, tablet, computer);
- in overall performance;
- in security.
